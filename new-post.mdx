we recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data)
whenever possible because your page can be built once and served with CDN,
whitch makes it much faster and having a server render the page on every
request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentations

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of
a user's request?" If the answer is yes then you should choose Static
Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you
can not pre-render a page a head of a user's request. Maybe your page
shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every
request.
