Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and
**Server Side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates
the HTML for a page.

```ts
const sum = (num1: number, num2: number): number => {
  return num1 + num2;
};
console.log(sum(4, 8)); //12
```

-**Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the
HTML at **Build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each
request. -**Server Side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates
the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, next.js let you **choose** witch pre-rendering form to use
for each page. You can create a "hybrid" next.js app by using static
generation for most pages and using server side rendering for others.
